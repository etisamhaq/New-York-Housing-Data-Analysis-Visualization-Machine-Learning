# New York Housing Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing, and Machine Learning** applied to New York's housing data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models for housing prices.  

## Objectives  
- Perform **EDA** using Pandas and NumPy.  
- Conduct **statistical analysis** (central tendency, dispersion, correlation).  
- Create **visualizations** (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation matrices).  
- Formulate and test **two hypotheses** using statistical tests.  
- Apply **two machine learning models** to predict housing prices.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation & analysis)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine learning)  
- **SciPy & Statsmodels** (Hypothesis testing)  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains housing-related information, including property features, pricing, and location-based attributes for properties in New York.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.  
- Analyzed data distributions using histograms and box plots.  
- Examined correlations between variables to identify key relationships.  
- Performed grouping and aggregation to summarize trends.  

## Hypothesis Testing  
Two hypotheses were tested using statistical methods:  
1. **"Larger properties have significantly higher prices than smaller properties."**  
   - Tested using a **t-test**.  
2. **"Housing prices differ significantly across different boroughs."**  
   - Tested using a **chi-square test**.  

## Machine Learning Models  
- **Linear Regression** – Built and evaluated a simple predictive model.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** – Applied an advanced ensemble model for better accuracy.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Used **RMSE, R² score** for model evaluation.  

## Results & Insights  
- Certain property features strongly influence pricing (e.g., size, location).  
- Prices vary significantly across boroughs, confirming our hypothesis.  
- Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression in predicting prices.
