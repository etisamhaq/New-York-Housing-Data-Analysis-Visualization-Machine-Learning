# New-York-Housing-Data-Analysis-Visualization-Machine-Learning

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in conducting Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, 
specifically Pandas and NumPy, and to create insightful visualizations and finally apply Machine Learning Algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Utilize Pandas andNumPy for in-depth data analysis.
• Conductstatistical analysis, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation.
• Perform advanced grouping andaggregation, exploring relationships between multiple variables.
• Extract meaningful insightsfrom the data through descriptive statistics.

Data Visualization:
• Create a variety of visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
• Include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlationmatrices.
• Clearly annotate and label visualizationsfor effective communication.

Hypothesis Testing:
• Formulate two hypotheses related to the dataset.
• Use statistical tests(t-test, chi-square, etc.) to validate or refute the hypotheses.

Advanced Analysis:
• Apply two machine learning techniques relevant to the dataset.
• Validatemodel performance and interpret results.
